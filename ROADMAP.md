# 🛣️ Fusion Stack Roadmap | Plasma MXI (01Fusion)

## 🎯 Objective
Build a prototype control loop that uses AI to monitor, predict, and optimize performance in LENR-based micro-reactor environments.

---

## ✅ Phase 0: Simulation + Model Development

- [x] `stream_parser.py` — Simulated thermal, voltage, and current input
- [x] `train_predictor.py` — Trains simple ML model on mock efficiency data
- [x] `model_predictor.py` — Loads trained model for inference
- [ ] `dashboard.py` — Visual output of predictions and trends
- [ ] `prototype_walkthrough.ipynb` — Jupyter demo of full pipeline

---

## 🔁 Phase 1: Real Data Integration

- [ ] Integrate real LENR datasets (OMAS, DIII-D, FAIR)
- [ ] Normalize and convert to training format
- [ ] Retrain predictive model on real-world data
- [ ] Begin fusion feedback loop design (PID + ML hybrid)

---

## 🤖 Phase 2: Embedded Deployment + Robotics

- [ ] Port ML model to embedded hardware (TF Lite, PyTorch Mobile)
- [ ] Interface with actuator/motor control systems
- [ ] Implement real-time safety cutoff protocols
